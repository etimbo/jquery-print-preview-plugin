# jQuery Print Preview plugin
## 9-18-13 Updates
- Updated for $.browser being deprecated in jQuery 1.9 (side-effect: removed support for IE 7 & below)
- Updated demo file to use jQuery 1.10.2 & removed carousel which was dependent on the jquerytools library that was previously being used. 

The jQuery Print Preview plugin is designed to provide visitors with a preview of the print version of a web site.
Unlike traditional print previews this plugin brings in all content and print styles within a modal window.
